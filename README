This is an overlay containing only the parts of learn.avdi.codes that we want to keep under revision control.

Forked from https://github.com/avdi/avdi.codes

E.g. site-specific plugin, child theme, maybe config.

Useful scripts are found in ./scripts

- ./scripts/copy-from-staging.sh: will overwrite local files with whatever's in staging
